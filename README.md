# The Moviedb
Simple Apps that use MovieDB API

### What i use:
- Testing: Barista (Espresso Framework)
- Coroutine
- Kotlin
- Endless Recyclerview
- etc.

### Requirement:
- Internet connection

# How to test
1. For safety, please test this in emulator when instrumented testing
Because, in my device, Xiaomi, the Activity never launch. Maybe from Xiaomi Security.

2. Please disable emulator animation
On your device, under Settings > Developer options, disable the following 3 settings:

- Window animation scale
- Transition animation scale
- Animator duration scale
